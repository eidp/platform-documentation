# CI/CD

EIDP's platform is designed to be used directly in the CI/CD system of your code platform. Our platform provides a set of standardised CI/CD components and pipelines that can be used by you to build high quality CI/CD pipelines with minimal effort.
 These components and pipelines provide a "golden path" that represents best practices for CI/CD.

The available pipelines and components enforce security, quality, and compliance while remaining extensible.

Before diving into the details of the actual components, we recommend to read the [EIDP CI/CD philosophy](philosophy.md) to get a better understanding of the ideas behind the EIDP CI/CD components and pipelines.
