# CI/CD

CI/CD is very important in modern software development.
At EIDP we believe that a good CI/CD setup is crucial for the success of a project.
You should invest time and effort into setting up a good CI/CD pipeline that fits your needs.
It allows teams to deliver software faster and with higher quality by automating the build, test, and deployment processes.
Hence, our platform provides a set of standardized CI/CD components and pipelines that can be used by you to build high quality CI/CD pipelines with minimal effort.
These components and pipelines provide a "golden path" that represents best practices for CI/CD.

The available pipelines and components enforce security, quality, and compliance while remaining extensible.

Before diving into the details of the actual components, we recommend to read the [EIDP CI/CD philosophy](philosophy.md) to get a better understanding of the ideas behind the EIDP CI/CD components and pipelines.
