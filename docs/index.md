# EIDP Platform Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the European Internal Developer Platform (EIDP). EIDP helps you ship the products and
services you develop, by handling reliability, performance, security, and European data sovereignty for you. This
documentation explains how.

## What is EIDP?

EIDP is an Internal Developer Platform delivered as a managed service. It provides an opinionated yet flexible way to
ship applications and services, by giving you a layer of self‑service tooling, infrastructure abstractions, and
guardrails. Product teams use this to focus on delivering business value instead of spending time on undifferentiated
platform plumbing.

The platform is built on the following pillars:

- **Great out-of-the-box experience**: standardized golden paths for environments, CI/CD, runtime, and observability.
- **Sovereignty**: all data & workloads are run in data centers within the European Union, run by European owners.
- **Scalability**: cloud‑native, elastic infrastructure with automated capacity management.
- **Operational excellence**: run your product with identity management, security patching, and monitoring facilities.
- **Data protection**: environments run using compute, network and storage resources that are isolated and protected.
