# EIDP Platform Documentation

This repo contains the Customer‑facing documentation for the EIDP platform.

## Tech Stack

- Framework: Docusaurus 3 (classic preset)
- Language: Markdown/MDX, TypeScript
- Styling: Custom CSS overrides in `src/css/custom.css`
- i18n: English

## Development

Requirements: Node.js 20+ (LTS), npm.

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start dev server (hot reload):

```bash
npm start
```

Build production bundle:

```bash
npm run build
```

Serve built site locally (to test prod output):

```bash
npm run serve
```

### Authoring Guidelines

- Prefer concise, task‑oriented language.
- Use tables for capability matrices & comparisons.
- For commands: fenced code blocks, single command per line.

### Adding a New Doc

1. Create file under appropriate folder in `docs/`.
2. Add to `sidebars.js` (or set `sidebar_position` in frontmatter if you switch to autogenerated categories later).
3. Run `npm start` and verify navigation + no broken links.

### Link Conventions

Use relative links (e.g. `../platform/features`) so they work across locales. Avoid hardcoding domain URLs unless external.

### Pre-commit hooks

To ensure code quality and consistency, this repository uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks. Make sure to
install the pre-commit hooks by running:

```bash
pre-commit install
```
