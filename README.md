# EIDP Platform Documentation

This repo contains the Customer‑facing documentation for the EIDP platform.

## Tech Stack
- Framework: Docusaurus 3 (classic preset)
- Language: Markdown/MDX, TypeScript
- Styling: Custom CSS overrides in `src/css/custom.css`
- i18n: English

## Getting Started (Local)
Requirements: Node.js 20+ (LTS), npm.

Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Start dev server (hot reload):
```
npm start
```

Build production bundle:
```
npm run build
```

Serve built site locally (to test prod output):
```
npm run serve
```

## Authoring Guidelines
- Prefer concise, task‑oriented language.
- Use tables for capability matrices & comparisons.
- For commands: fenced code blocks, single command per line.

## Adding a New Doc
1. Create file under appropriate folder in `docs/`.
2. Add to `sidebars.js` (or set `sidebar_position` in frontmatter if you switch to autogenerated categories later).
3. Run `npm start` and verify navigation + no broken links.

## Link Conventions
Use relative links (e.g. `../platform/features`) so they work across locales. Avoid hardcoding domain URLs unless external.

## Deployment
- CI should run `npm ci && npm run build` and publish the `build/` directory.
- Optionally enable broken link checking (already set to `throw`).
